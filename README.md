Keyboard layout bundle for macOS, including :

- Colemak Mod-DHm (First revision of Mod-DH with M key in home row)
- DHm\* (Restore ⌘+V position to original position for ease of use)

## Installation

Taken from [ColemakMods/mod-dh](https://github.com/ColemakMods/mod-dh/tree/master/OS_X)

To install, copy the ColemakDHm.bundle folder to either
~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts
or
/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts

```shell
sudo cp -r /path/to/Colemak-DHm/ColemakDHm.bundle /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts
```

It doesn’t take admin privileges to install in ~/Library, but OS X will revert
back to QWERTY every time you type in a password.
